# My Learnings

List of all the works I am doing or done â˜º

##### 1. NFT App

A dummy app with list of NFTs that can be browsed. I made it while learning for React Native. There are 2 parts for this app:

- Landing Page - Made with **React and Tailwind Css**, described in various sections with different images of the app.
- The App itself - Made with **React Native and Expo** - You can view it in your Expo app by scanning the QR code whose link can be found in the Landing page.

Skills used:

> React, React Native, Tailwind Css, Expo

All the details can be found by visiting the Landing page and the repo.
